                    Travel MVP was created to make travel simpler, more prepared, and stress-free for students and athletes on the go. Founded by 2 student entrepreneurs, Travel MVP was built around a simple idea: no traveler should arrive at a tournament, school trip, or weekend getaway without the hygiene essentials they need.
                </p>

                    We provide ready-to-go travel hygiene kits designed specifically for active lifestyles. Our company allows you to customize each kit to your desire, with the ability to pick and choose between a variety of essential travel-size personal care items packed in a durable, and customizable pouch that fits easily into backpacks, duffel bags, and carry-ons. Whether it's a long tournament weekend, a school trip, or everyday travel, Travel MVP helps travelers stay fresh, confident, and focused.
